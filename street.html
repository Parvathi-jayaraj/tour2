            <h2>'SM Street'</h2>
            <p>S.M. Street (short for Sweet Meat Street), located in the heart of Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala, is one of the oldest and most vibrant commercial streets in the region. It is a bustling hub of trade, culture, and history, drawing locals and tourists alike. The street derives its name from the sweetmeat (halwa) shops set up by Gujarati traders during the colonial era. The iconic Kozhikode Halwa, a sticky, colorful dessert, remains a hallmark of the street to this day. S.M. Street is deeply rooted in Kozhikode's rich trading history, having served as a prominent marketplace during the time of the Zamorins (local rulers) and later during Portuguese, Dutch, and British rule. S.M. Street is a paradise for shoppers, offering a mix of traditional and modern goods. Items such as textiles, jewelry, spices, handicrafts, and electronics are readily available.
